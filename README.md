# Building-IDV-with-D3
Source code skeleton for Packt Publishing's Building Interactive Data Visualisations with D3.

The course was built using D3.js Version 3.x. Some parts will fail with the latest version 4.x.

*Errata/Changes*

The Observatory of Economic Complexity (OEC) has changed their API since this course was created.

* The HTTPS entry way has been removed. One may now only access the site with HTTP.

* The Harmonized System (/hs/...) product classification has been expanded to cover multiple system specifications. Replacing "/hs/..." with "/hs92/..." will fix this issue.
